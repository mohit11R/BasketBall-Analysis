## Report Insight

* Over the year; Kobe's salary trended upwards however, we can see a drastic dip in the year 2014 and this is because of his injuries happened to him in the games on his prior matches for which he couldn't able to play more matches
* Over the year; Joe Johnson salary remained lower than that of Kobe Bryant's.
- Joe's salary trended upwards as the year progresses and it seems that the salary equation might change in the future years.
- Kevin Durant seems to utilize much of his time in making goals and over the years we can see a increasing trend for him in "field goals per minutes played" chart
